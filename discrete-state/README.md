### BEAST tMRCA analysis on H5N1 2.3.4.4b strains from the US, including the strains from the March-April 2024 outbreak in dairy cattle ###
This analysis uses BEAST v1.10.4: [https://beast.community](https://beast.community).

#### File structure ####
- .xml: non-functional xml files generated by BEAUTI v1.10.4. This file has the GISAID sequence data removed and will not work.

#### Step-by-step: ####

1. Combine the GISAID sequences with the IRMA sequences from this analysis - genbank accessions pending.

2. input into BEAUTI, parse the dates, and configure the analysis 

2. Analyses were run multiple times, and after inspection the logs and trees were combined (LogCombiner v1.10.4), and a single MCC was generated using TreeAnnotator v1.10.4.
